# REASON:
# 1. Ghostty doesn't doesn't have conditionals that allow me to have vimish keybindings outside vim
# without interferring with vim
# 2. Ghostty uses macos native tabs which does not work with my current window manager (Aerospace)

# REVIEW: Might no longer be needed after clearing all keybinds?
